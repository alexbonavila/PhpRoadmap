# Introduction

This modest project is developed using PHP 8.2, enabling the author to review and demonstrate their knowledge of PHP and MongoDB. It is not meant to serve as a guide or a manual for best practices.

The project is designed to include an implementation of a MongoDB database utilizing raw PHP and composer.

Additionally, this project is a component of a PHP roadmap, which is in turn part of a series of such roadmaps. The PHP Roadmap can be accessed at the following URL:
